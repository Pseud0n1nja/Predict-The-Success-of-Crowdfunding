# Predict-The-Success-of-Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter, where entrepreneurs and artists seek for support from a large number of contributors, has become prominent over the past decade. Better understanding and more accurate prediction of the success of a project can help both contributors and creators make better use of their resources. Previous works applied traditional machine learning methods, such as SVM and Random Forest, with only categorical and numerical features, such as goal and duration, or only textual features, such as project description and keywords. To our knowledge, we are the first work to apply deep neural networks with all three types of features. Using a dataset of 100K+ crowdfunding projects, our model achieves 72.78\% accuracy on test set, which is significantly better than the baselines and the previous works. We also show that the trained model can help us understand the success and failure of crowdfunding projects better.
